    JavaScript is a scripting or programming language that allows you to 
    implement complex features on web pages — every time a web page does more than just sit
     there and display static information for you to look at — displaying displaying timely content updates, 
    interactive maps, animated 2D/3D graphics,
     scrolling video jukeboxes, etc. — you can bet that JavaScript is probably involved. 
    
    
    JavaScript is a scripting language that enables you to create dynamically updating content,
     control multimedia, animate images, and pretty much everything else.

    A JavaScript function is a block of code designed to perform a particular task.

A JavaScript function is executed when "something" invokes it (calls it).
A JavaScript function is defined with the function keyword, followed by a name, followed by parentheses ().
