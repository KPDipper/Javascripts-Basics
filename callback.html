        // In synchronous operations tasks are performed one at a time and only when one is completed, 
        // the following is unblocked. 
        // In other words, you need to wait for a task to finish to move to the next one. 

        // In asynchronous operations, on the other hand, 
        // you can move to another task before the previous one finishes.
        //  This way, with asynchronous programming youâ€™re able to deal with multiple requests simultaneously,
        //   thus completing more tasks in a much shorter period of time.
