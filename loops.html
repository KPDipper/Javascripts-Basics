        //2.do-while
        //3.for//there basic for every programming language

        //yes ma tintia kua chaincha
        // euta initilization:where to start
        // condition check garne:when to end
        // statment:what to do when conditions are true
        //increment/decrement :procced to next statement

         //increment/decrement
        //}here condition true bhyo bhane statement execute hune bhyo tespachi increment athawa decrement huncha
        //milena bhane loop bhanda bhaira aucha

        // difference that it checks for the condition after executing the statements, 
        //and therefore is an example of Exit Control Loop.
