A programming language is a vocabulary and set of grammatical
rules for instructing a computer or computing device to perform
specific tasks.
• The term programming language usually refers to high-level
languages, such as BASIC, C, C++, COBOL, Java, FORTRAN, Ada,
and Pascal.
• Each language has a unique set of keywords (words that it
understands) and a special syntax for organizing

It is a set of instructions written in any specific language ( C, C++, Java, Python) to perform a specific task.

In computer science, a programming language is said to have first-class functions if it treats functions as first-class citizens.
 This means the language supports passing functions as arguments to other functions, 
returning them as the values from other functions, and assigning them to variables or storing them in data structures
